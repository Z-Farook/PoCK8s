# The use cases for CGI Pivot


## The feature dir contains use case scenarios for the PoC for Pivot.
## They are written using a business language called Gherkin that can be found here: https://cucumber.io/docs/gherkin/reference/ 
### The letter R with a number refers to a requirement defined in the thesis, 5.2. So, if you see R1 it points to requirement 1.
### All the names used in the Scenarios are imaginary CGI employees.
