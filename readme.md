# The use cases for CGI Pivot

- The feature dir contains use case scenarios for the PoC for Pivot.
- The BehaveExampleInAction dir contains an example use case scenario Gherkin and Behave. Please see the readme in BehaveExampleInAction dir for setup instructions. 

- Use cases are written using a business language called Gherkin that can be found here: https://cucumber.io/docs/gherkin/reference/ 
- The letter R with a number refers to a requirement defined in the thesis, 5.2. So, if you see R1 it points to requirement 1.
- All the names used in the Scenarios are imaginary CGI employees.
- Regarding the PythonBehaveTesting visit: https://behave.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorial.html.
